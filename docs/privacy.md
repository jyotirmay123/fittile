# Privacy and data ownership

Fitile is designed around local-first, user-owned health records.

## What is stored

- Profile goals, preferences, equipment, and limitations
- Workout sessions, set weights/repetitions, soreness, and recovery inputs
- Meals, portions, nutrition estimates, activities, and body measurements
- Sync metadata needed to reconcile offline edits

Local records live in the browser/app’s IndexedDB. When cloud mode is configured and the user signs in, supported records are copied to the user’s Supabase account so their mobile and laptop stay synchronized. Database row-level-security policies scope each private row to the authenticated user ID.

## Photos, barcodes, and AI

Barcode numbers are sent to Fitile’s server function and Open Food Facts for product lookup. Meal photos are sent to Fitile’s authenticated server function and the configured AI provider only when the user requests an estimate. Fitile requests non-persistent AI processing (`store: false`) and saves the structured estimate—not the original photo—after the user confirms it. Infrastructure/provider logs and retention are governed by the operator’s chosen Supabase and AI account settings.

Never place AI or service-role secrets in `.env.local`, compiled JavaScript, or the APK. Only publishable Supabase values may be client-side.

## User controls

The Data & sync screen provides:

- A versioned JSON archive intended for complete restore
- Separate CSV files for readable/portable analysis
- Archive validation before restore
- Sign-out and an account-deletion control when cloud mode is configured

The operator should connect the deletion control to a re-authenticated server endpoint before accepting public users. A production privacy notice should identify the operator, contact address, hosting region, processors, retention policy, lawful basis, and GDPR rights.

## Safety and accuracy

Recovery readiness, calories burned, food-photo analysis, barcode data, and nutrient totals are estimates. They are not diagnoses, medical advice, or substitutes for package labels and professional care. Stop exercise and seek appropriate help for sharp pain, chest pain, dizziness, or unusual shortness of breath.
